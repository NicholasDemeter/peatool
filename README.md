Help! I’m Looking for help to create a way to improve international development using meta-data, natural language processing (NLP) or other data collection tool to help leaders in developing economies identify who to collaborate with. The background of the tool is political economy analysis (PEA) which are usually boring, uninformative documents. I’d like to provide a meta data driven tool for creating political economy analysis maps and visualizations. PEA maps or "power maps" highlight the key 1) people 2) institutions and 3) policies that have power or leverage in a developing country to affect change for the positive or negative. There are a TON of processed data sets available and I have a growing list of open data sources, but I lack the programming skills to create the platform I envision. Please help if you have the skills or even know the skills I need. I'm assuming API and NLP are likely sources, but I'm hoping there's already something "off the shelf" that I can use. I would like to give this tool to every international mission trying to help the world’s poorest nations and people.
